"Dobrynya", "Alyosha" and "Ilyusha" are experienced tractors you did not know about


The history of domestic tractor plants can be studied endlessly, gradually plunging deeper and deeper into the unknown stages of the life of a particular manufacturer.
In general, little is written about tractors, and even more so about promising developments that appeared at a certain moment, and then disappeared into oblivion.
Today I will tell you about the promising developments of the Altai Tractor Plant in the late 90s. You will get acquainted with the tractors "Dobrynya", "Alyosha" and "Ilyusha".
T-408 Dobrynya
The names are, of course, extremely funny. Probably, the plant wanted to use the names of Russian heroes to show the power of the new tractors.
The highest hopes were pinned on the 4-5 traction-class tracked tractor T-408 Dobrynya. The only prototype was made in 1998 and turned out to be a pretty good and promising machine.
But the design turned out to be rather controversial. A feeling of "crookedness" of the tractor was created, created, first of all, by the cab with a tilted front post.
T-408 Dobrynya
She somehow very badly combined with the sloping hood, so the handsome "Dobrynya" can hardly be called.
A diesel engine D-461-13I with a capacity of 150 hp was installed in front. It provided a working speed range of 3 to 15 km / h when moving forward and 4.7 to 10 km / h when moving back.
The tractor weighed 11 tons and reached a length of almost 6.5 meters. There is not much information on it, but I managed to dig up the original footage on YouTube, where you can see the T-408 in motion and even see what the cabin looked like from the inside.
A more compact version of the T-408 was the T-406 "Alyosha" tracked tractor (which Popovich, of course). Both models were unified as much as possible - they had a common cab, hood, engine and chassis elements.
For the first time, tracked tractors of such classes received front aggregation. Those. it was possible to hitch agricultural equipment not only from the back, but also from the front.

All tractors have paid special attention to the comfort of the tractor driver. The new cabins received improved sound and thermal insulation, a new seat with a head restraint, revised ergonomics of the workplace in order to reduce energy consumption.
In general, the T-406 looked very similar, except that the proportions were slightly different.

Its weight was 9.3 tons, overall dimensions - 5450x1950x2960 mm. It could engine with operating speeds of 2.67 to 11.4 km / h forward and 4 to 7.8 km / h backward.
You can also watch an old school video showing the T-406 in motion:
The heaviest model in the promising range was the T-500 "Ilyusha" (1999). Its weight reached 12 tons (a ton more than the T-408), and its overall dimensions were 6550x2250x3100 mm.
At the same time, it was also equipped with a more efficient diesel engine D-4601 with a capacity of 250 hp, which allowed it to move at speeds from 4.6 to 17.9 km / h forward and from 4 to 6 km / h - backward.

Ilyusha was tested a lot in combat conditions. He worked in a coal warehouse and shovel sand as a heavy bulldozer.
By the way, an interesting feature: the door was only on the left, and it did not swing open, but opened slightly and moved along the cab using a special lever. I wonder how practical this solution was?
Watch a short video of testing a tractor at a coal warehouse:
There was one more model - the T-407 "Alyosha". Unfortunately, there is no information on it at all.
The T-407 had a similar cockpit, but a slightly different hood shape. I suppose that it became the next stage in the development of the T-406 prototype, because it bore the same proper name.

Interestingly, there was also a prototype of a wheeled version of the tractor - T-407K. He looked really quite ugly and unfinished.
Probably, the designers were just checking the possibility of using the created aggregate base for the new layout.

Unfortunately, none of the tractors reached serial production. The end of the 1990s turned out to be a very difficult economic stage in the development of Russia.
The plant itself remained afloat until 2011, after which, due to the accumulated debt, it was declared bankrupt.
Two years later, LLC "Plant Altai Tractor" was created, which even tried to resume production of the T-404. But at the beginning of 2018, Altai Traktor Plant LLC is a small company with an authorized capital of 20,000 rubles and zero financial statements for 2015 and 2016 ...
----------------------------------When the old house was being demolished, I found an iron box in the attic. I show its contents


Quite recently, my relatives called me and told me that they would soon demolish their house. It sounds loud, but in fact it is a very small house, in which no one has lived for 30 years. It was used as a barn to store all kinds of equipment, tools and bicycles. But it was built at the very beginning of the 20th century. I have been waiting for this event for a long time, hoping for interesting finds. In general, I came to the place to help in the analysis, and the first thing we started with was removing everything that had accumulated there over the years from the attic. There was nothing interesting there, except for one single iron box, obviously filled with something.

When I opened it, I saw a whole bunch of electrical fittings (sockets, plugs, cartridges, various radio components). But first of all, I was interested in bottles with some reagents. The first bottle was a bluish powder. The inscription on the label read "Ferrous sulphate ferrous". Perhaps it was used in photography, or maybe as a fertilizer, I don't know.
Another bottle was wrapped in cellophane and sealed with a round paper seal. The label was almost not preserved, but inside there was a yellowish powder. Didn't open it, suddenly some kind of poison.

But the last two bottles turned out to be with oil. Yes, with real crude oil. Judging by the label, it was spilled by the Cherkasy Chemical Reagent Plant in the 3rd quarter of 1967. This was unexpected.

Naturally, I opened one of the bottles and spilled oil, albeit on a microscopic scale.
There was nothing more interesting in the box. I decided to keep the oil for myself. So I can tell my friends that I am engaged in oilüòÑ

Have a nice day!
----------------------------------What foreign stars would look like if they dressed like our grandmothers and lived in the Russian outback (before and after photos)


Greetings, dear women of fashion)))
For some reason, very often they compare our grandmothers and foreign residents. Indeed, our women in their entire lives are so worked out that they are inferior to their peers from abroad.
So I decided to see how their star beauties of old age will look like in the images of our women who live in the outback and wear headscarves.
Photo is used for example. Photo source: //
Who will suit this traditional Russian wardrobe item, and who shouldn't tie a Russian headscarf on their heads ... let's see.
By the way, I didn't wash my makeup, let them stay with him. Moreover, the plastic is also in place)
Look 1. Kim Cattrall, Canadian actress
Remember Samantha, one of the four girlfriends from the famous movie?
collage of the author
In my opinion, Kim turned out to be such a smart old woman.
Image 2. Jane Fonda, American actress.
collage of the author
She's 82 now, can you imagine? And for me, she remains the same fit and athletic model when she demonstrated very exciting aerobics from video tapes. At that time our men looked at her, and women were jealous.
Therefore, I did not allocate a handkerchief to her, but only a hat ... let him be smart)))
Image 3. Sigourney Weaver, American actress
collage of the author
Wow! How does a scarf fit for her, tied in this way. She really began to look like our granny from the outback, only the 70-year-old actress does not look at her age at all.
But for the average village woman, she will pass. Such a hard worker, a hard worker who came out, well, let's say on May 1)))
Image 4. Sophia Loren, Italian actress
collage of the author
To be honest, I giggled for a long time looking at the photo of the resulting villager. With such makeup, she is straight - fire!
No, Sophie, you are not at all like a Russian granny from the provinces, some kind of glamorous turned out. Our grandmothers are not at all like that, and if they use cosmetics, then only a little, maximum lipstick, and eyebrows let down.
And, I really liked these images. Perhaps they do not resemble grannies, but a Russian beauty, these women can definitely be called.
Look 5. Judy Dench, British actress
collage of the author
Look how she looks red! And the Pavlovo Posad shawl thrown over his head ?! Beauty!
From her usual image of a cold British lady, she immediately became a very sweet and charming woman.
I really like it, do you?
Image 6. Meryl Streep, American actress.
collage of the author
I would never have thought that this stately lady in a scarf would look so stunning.
Agree, the image turned out to be very feminine, a minimum of cosmetics, natural makeup. Very beautiful)
Image 7. Ellen Burstyn, American actress.
collage of the author
Another image that I really liked. I would even note that this elderly woman is wearing a stylishly selected, modern bow.
A delicate pink shawl is harmoniously combined with a jacket with a "motley" print. A very feminine image.
And, of course, as always, I ask you not to take my next fantasy seriously)))
How do you like these foreign ladies, which image did you find most successful?
Thanks for reading. Always yours, MODNESS.

----------------------------------An acquaintance told how cucumbers are planted in Iceland: I did the same, very convenient and saves a lot of time


Photo by the author
So our "sadistic" season is coming to an end. It seems that everything that needs to be planted, planted, fertilized, pruned. The only unfinished business was a new greenhouse for cucumbers. I've fumbled with her for too long.
There were reasons for that: recently, strong winds and storms have become more frequent in the Urals, so it was necessary to make the most durable structure. Purchased greenhouses are blown away at once, from a friend after a strong wind three days ago, a new greenhouse was carried back through three sections. All polycarbonate in the trash. So the greenhouse had to be done conscientiously, with a special strengthening system, the other day I'll tell you about it.
And today, can I brag a little?
In the new greenhouse we made cucumber beds like in Iceland. A good friend of mine, a videographer and travel blogger, was there on a long trip last year and told how native Icelanders with Icelanders and Icelanders grow vegetables in their home greenhouses.
Photo by the author
Iceland is located in a subarctic region, but does not have a harsh climate. In winter, they rarely get below -10 degrees, but in summer there is no particular heat. Therefore, greenhouses and high-quality planting of vegetables and all kinds of greenery is a matter of survival.
In Iceland, greenhouses are heated by the energy of volcanoes and geysers. In the Urals, neither one nor the other is observed. Naturally, I did not dig a mine to a depth of several kilometers to get to the red-hot lava. Although Natalia walked around the greenhouse, maybe she was looking for a place for a mine!
I was interested in a completely different moment.
Photo by the author
Traditionally in Russia, cucumbers are tied up. Someone makes reiki-sticks, someone "makes" some cleverly wise crossbars, someone pulls ropes from old nylon tights. A friend said that Icelanders do not tie tomatoes and cucumbers at all in their greenhouses.
From the word at all!
In their greenhouses there are high beds, in which there are pipes with heating, and a special net is stretched over the beds themselves. As soon as the cucumber sprouts begin to release the mustache, they immediately bump into the net and begin to actively climb up.
Photo by the author
All the greens quickly entwine the net, and the cucumbers hang on both sides of it. You don't need to tie anything up. A lot of time, space is saved, and it looks more aesthetically pleasing than tight tights or ropes. After the cucumbers are ripe, the lash is trimmed and dried. Then it can be quickly and effortlessly torn from the net.
When Natalia found out about this method of planting cucumbers ... in short, I was simply left with no choice.
Thank you, Maxim, I killed the day for this construction!
The only consolation was that I immediately decided for myself that I would write about it in Zen. But even myself wondered how it would look. In the absence of a special "Icelandic" mesh, I had to go and buy a simple plastic trellis. Its advantage is that it does not rot and does not rust.

By the way, again on the advice of Maxim, one of these days I will make a top watering system for cucumbers. I opened the tap and everything poured out - no need to stand with the hose. Now this is important - in the summer it will be necessary to make up for the time lost in April and May, so the less time is spent on watering and maintaining the garden and plot, the better.

----------------------------------11 funny photos and videos about cars and not only


Don't forget to look at the previous part as well >>
Roads in Russia are the pain of all motorists. Of course, there are exceptions, but in general, some sections cannot be called roads. I personally had the experience of traveling through Syzran, and so you cannot imagine how sorry I felt for the suspension of my car.
Traffic services sometimes try to somehow rectify the situation in the most dead areas, filling the holes with gravel or patching, but it doesn't get better.
But in the photo that you see below, albeit an asphalt, but rather amusing lane on the section of the road where the repair was made, is captured. Did everyone imagine how funny it is to ride on it?
People with weak vestibular apparatus should be especially careful about such fun trips.

One day, while cycling around the city, I was stopped by a police officer with a request to show the documents on the purchase of my bike. It just so happened that my bike was very similar in color to the one on the wanted list. Sound familiar?
So vigilant drivers are very responsible when it comes to protecting their car.
But sometimes the line between responsibility and insanity is thin and at such moments you get what you see in this photo. Just look at this anti-theft construction!

How weak is it to grow a mini botanical garden in the headlight of your car? And the owner of the car, the headlight of which you see below, does not. Most likely, he killed his swallow on the roads so much that everything got loose and something fell off, resulting in a natural optics tuning.
Jokes, jokes, of course, but how could you start your car. I would like to believe that this photo was taken at some kind of dump, rather than accept the fact that there are notorious car owners who care.
By the way, who can name the brand and model of the car?

Jeeps are not afraid of dirt! But no, in my opinion, some are still afraid. Look at this one, which the owner carefully and for a long time wrapped with foil in order to save his handsome man from dirt and branches. By the way, the driver probably climbed through the window behind the wheel.
But the question is: why purposefully drive a car that you are afraid to get dirty and scratched on such a road? And this type of packaging will not 100% save the car body from all these negative influences.

Now look at another lover of cleanliness. Everyone knows that in large stores like Auchan, potatoes are sold, both washed and not washed.
The only difference is in the price, washed is more expensive. So the dude in the photo below, in an attempt to save money, bought several nets of unwashed potatoes.
After he loaded his purchase on the roof of the car, he apparently felt sorry for the dirt on him.
The idea of how to get out of this situation came by itself - to wash the potatoes and the car at the same time at a self-service car wash. Laughingly brilliant life hack!

But looking at the next photo, willy-nilly, I remember those drivers in whose cabin medical masks hang wherever possible, while the drivers and their passengers are wearing masks. I personally observed one amusing incident.
I am standing at a traffic light, a car drives up to the right, in the cabin of which the husband (driver) and his wife are sitting. Both are wearing masks and gloves. Well, okay, I think that I didn‚Äôt, I didn‚Äôt see them, but then it was just funny.
The driver, who walked in fig gloves, knows how long and where, clearly fearing the virus, he simply rubs his eyes with his gloved hands while continuing to chat with his wife. In a slight bewilderment and laughing, I rolled on.
So I will not be surprised that many will soon start hiding their cars from radars in the same way as you in the photo. In the end, you have to put so many masks somewhere.

Do you remember that resourceful guy who washed potatoes at the self-service car wash in the photo above? So, it turns out that such a sink can be arranged for free right in the yard of your house.
Look at how cars in Russia are washed by those who feel sorry for money for washing. How precise the hose stream is! All that is missing is the wife, who will then have to wipe the car with a rag.

To be honest, at first I thought it was some kind of photomontage, not a real photo. But it seems that it really happened in reality.
Apparently, one of the mechanics decided to tweak something under the hood of the racing
Only instead of removing the hood, he decided to use the oval front grille, where he literally climbed up without any problems.

In recent years, the central part of Russia has been experiencing incredible heat. It is especially difficult for drivers whose cars are not equipped with air conditioning.
But there are life hacks here too! The driver of an old GAZelle, for example, stuck out not only his hand, but also his left leg through the door window. True, without a shoe, but only in a sock.
It looks a little strange, but all methods are good for fighting the heat!

Driving women is generally a separate art form. This is such a vigorous combination of pain, laughter, surprise and the question "how ?!" from the side of men,The traffic police inspector asked: "breathe in a tube": 3 safest answers


Greetings, friends!
Examination for the state of intoxication is an unpleasant, and sometimes even humiliating procedure, which traffic police inspectors offer to go through with or without reason. Even non-drinking drivers often find themselves in such a situation. But as practice shows, to look at a person in uniform with honest eyes and say "Yes, I don't drink at all!" useless. With such behavior, the driver only shows his confusion, voluntarily giving the initiative to the inspector.
If you immediately demonstrate your legal literacy, the unpleasant procedure can be avoided altogether. This will allow you to get out of the situation, preserving your dignity, and not to worry later about this incident. Let's figure out what you need to answer to the traffic police inspector, offering to "blow into the tube."

1. What signs of intoxication do I have?
The traffic police inspector has the right to insist on an examination only on condition that the driver has at least one of the signs of intoxication provided for in Article 3 of the Government Decree No. 475 of June 26, 2008. This can be poor coordination of movements, speech disorders, specific breath and other characteristic signs.
By asking a question and referring to a specific legal document, the driver demonstrates legal literacy that the inspector did not expect. Most likely, he will not insist, will try to smooth out the awkward situation with a few routine questions and wish you a good journey.
2. I ask to involve two witnesses, present a license for the device and demonstrate the integrity of the seal
DPS inspectors get used to the fact that the rules are violated by everyone around them, and the law is always on their side. Therefore, they neglect formalities and are not particularly eager to comply with them. However, the driver may require compliance with all formalities, as this right is guaranteed to him by Articles 4-9 of the above-mentioned regulation. The inspector will bother with this only if the driver really has at least one sign of intoxication. In other cases, he would prefer not to waste time and find someone not so legally savvy.
3. I refuse to use this device, I only agree to a medical examination
The traffic police inspector, if there is a real suspicion of intoxication, is obliged to provide a survey, but he cannot force the driver to use a specific device. Therefore, it is better to prefer an examination in a medical institution, since it is safer and more reliable. Of course, this procedure can take 2-3 hours of time from the driver, but in most cases the traffic police inspector refuses right away. If there are no obvious signs of intoxication, for him this is also a senseless waste of time. Every driver has the right to refuse to "blow into a tube", it is enshrined in Article 10 of the mentioned Government Decree No. 475.

----------------------------------The mother of two made the nursery look like a jungle. Photo Before and After


Becky Watts, 36, was so tired of the monotony and boring room of her children during self-isolation that she decided to fulfill their desire - to turn it into a jungle. The woman did not have money for large-scale repairs, so she used available tools and ingenuity.
Photos of the bedroom before renovation
Photos of the bedroom before renovation
‚ÄúMy kids wanted a jungle-style room, so I started with a set of drawers that a client had given me years ago. I painted it green and added gold pens, ‚Äùshe says.
Photos of the room after renovation

The woman then bought blue wall paint from a hardware store and hand-painted tiger stripes on the walls.
‚ÄúI found a tiger stripe drawing that I liked and copied it. On the other wall, I wanted to stick mottled wallpaper, but it cost about ¬£ 70 (RUR 6,200) a roll, so I just painted the wall white and painted the spots with the tip of a brush, ‚Äùsays Becky.

Becky's youngest son adores pandas, so the woman used them to the maximum in the decor.
‚ÄúI painted the beds in four different colors, because I was afraid that one color would not be enough for me, and there was no money to buy a second can. I chose mustard color to resemble a leopard or a giraffe, ‚Äùsays Becky.

Becky then painted the toy chest of drawers and redid the drawers under the bed, taking them from the dresser she wanted to throw away. She added artificial plants for a jungle atmosphere and a garland to make things look a little magical.


‚ÄúThe repair cost me only 150 pounds (13,500 rubles). All I needed was some good paint and a little imagination, ‚Äùsays Becky.
Did you like the rework?

----------------------------------I saw that a neighbor was putting a reflective screen on the windshield: he told him why it was a mistake


Greetings, friends!
Hot summer days are not particularly pleasing for drivers, especially those who have to leave their car in open and well-lit parking lots. Sometimes the sun's rays warm up the interior so much that it is simply impossible to stay in it, and the car has to be thoroughly ventilated for a long time.
Many hope to solve this problem with a sunscreen - a thick reflective curtain fitted to the windshield. Recently I noticed that a neighbor in the parking lot at the house leaves just such a protective screen on his car. Of course, such a screen is inexpensive and very easy to use, and the intended effect should be quite tangible. But there are significant drawbacks to using it. Let's figure it out.
// 288230376153108422 /
As you know, sunlight is largely composed of invisible infrared and ultraviolet radiation (especially in the middle of summer). The infrared part of the spectrum carries enormous amounts of heat. It is thanks to her that the interior warms up so much. And the ultraviolet component has a destructive effect on any objects. Because of it, paints fade, plastic dries up and cracks, all materials in the cabin are destroyed.
The sunscreen appears to solve these problems by blocking out the sun's rays. It is simply attached with suction cups, and if you choose the right size, it completely covers the windshield. At the same time, almost all commercially available screens are folded or folded, so they take up a minimum of space when not in use.
Cons of a sunscreen
Usually, if the parking space allows, the car is parked at such an angle that the protective screen completely covers the interior from the sun's rays. But the sun moves quickly, so after half an hour its rays begin to illuminate the interior through the side windows. However, this is not the main problem, since small reflective curtains are also sold for them.
The main problem is radiation to the windshield itself. Due to the reflection, it heats up a lot, and when the driver returns to the car and turns on the air conditioner, a sharp cooling occurs. This can lead to the formation of microcracks and the expansion of old defects. In rare cases, hot glass may crack completely immediately after turning on the air conditioner. They suffer from reflected ultraviolet radiation and wiper brushes, which quickly dry out under its influence.
How to replace the sunscreen?
It is much more effective to protect the car from solar radiation by using a regular cover. It is enough to throw it on the windshield and clamp it with the doors. This avoids the problems associated with sunscreens, while the vehicle's heat protection is much better because the cover is outside.

/Spitting Cobra: An animal that takes a spit to kill


How do snakes hit their victims and foes? They bite, poison with poison, strangle with their own body. But there are bastards who will cripple you even from a distance. Meet the sniper from the world of headless reptiles and the owner of the deadliest grunt on the planet - the spitting cobra!
Watering services: fast, high quality, inexpensive.
Spitting cobras are a whole genus of uncultured reptiles, which includes 5 species. These creatures could be called the most accurate shooters in the wild West, if they did not live in Africa and Asia.
The typical face of a person who tries to argue on the Internet.
The two-meter hose is a great reason not to take off your mask with glasses even after the quarantine is over. Unlike other snakes, our heroines literally sprinkle poison. Or rather, they shoot them as much as 3 meters! One shot = 3 milligrams of poison.
Scaly snipers aim not at the heart, but at the eyes. The toxin even eats away at the skin, let alone sensitive eyes. The poison causes clouding of the cornea, and there - hello blindness for the rest of your life.
The scientist Bruce Young from the University of Massachusetts found out all of the above. Risking his life and health, the scientist infuriated and in every possible way provoked the cobra in the laboratory.
Think dodging a no-arms shooter is easy? Yeah, right now! Cobras predict enemy movements 200 milliseconds ahead. Well, if the beast, nevertheless, missed - it doesn't matter, the clip of the reptile is ten-round, so you will definitely get your volley in the slurp.
If the reptile has a bad day and hasn't gotten it right with sniping, the reptile will spray the poison with a series of quick shots, as if from a spray bottle. Such a device will accurately hit the target, affecting not only the eyes, but also other mucous membranes. Isn't it lovely?
The totem animal of all those who love to cough in the porches.
But how did the spitting cobra turn from an ordinary snake into a poisonous machine gun? The whole secret is in anatomy. The poisonous gland is somewhere in the neck of the reptile. The poison comes out through the rounded holes in the teeth - there is nothing unusual here, this is the case with all snakes. But what distinguishes our heroine is her stiff neck. When contracted, special muscles press on the channels of the poisonous gland and the poison flies out. In addition, the holes in the teeth are not directed downward, like in other snakes, but forward, so a volley of toxins flies straight into the face of the offender.
The difference between the fangs of a regular snake (1) and a spitting snake (2).
The snake uses such a tricky mechanism only for defensive purposes. For hunting, the spitting cobra adheres to the classic snake strategy: it bites the victim, but does not let go immediately in order to pump up the prey with poison to the eyeballs. Spitting cobra's menu includes amphibians, lizards, rodents, birds and other snakes.
Despite the dangerous grubs, mongooses remain the main threat to cobras. These animals do not care that poison is spat on them, they still hunt cobras, remaining with the reptiles as sworn enemies.
But a person can also fall under the distribution if he did not have enough blinding shots. A cobra bite is deadly for us, although the speed of the poison's action depends on personality traits. Someone throws back their skates after a couple of hours, and someone suffers for several days - whoever is lucky.
Stasyan, damn it, when you already learn how to open champagne.
Toxic creatures become especially dangerous in January-February, during the breeding season. In April, female mothers who have laid eggs go completely off the rails. Zealously protecting their offspring, they shoot to kill without warning.
Ladies arrange masonry in a heap of forest debris. Rotting vegetation creates a kind of incubator for eggs, the number of which reaches 15 pieces. The hatched snakes, though small, are already quite dangerous. Children hunt insects to save poison. The older they get, the more poison they will accumulate. Therefore, the older the snake is, the more dangerous it is.
By the way. not all snakes are born from eggs. In the collar cobra, cubs are born by live birth.
Alas, neither sniper accuracy nor deadly poison save spitting cobras from humans. Painfully cheerfully bald primates destroy their habitat. In addition, among the sapiens there are guys with extremely specific tastes: wearing goggles and a mask, exotic lovers catch snakes from the wild to keep them in terrariums.

----------------------------------"Old age does not spare": What does the handsome actor Alain Delon look like at 84


How beautiful youth is and how unpleasant old age is. It affects everyone, sparing no one. On the one hand, it's great to live a long and happy life, but it's a shame that youth is not eternal. If you could live 100 years with a face and body, as if you were 20, it would be great. Who knows, maybe science will make such progress. In the meantime, there is, that is.
Alain Delon is by far the most handsome actor of all time, who will easily make it into the top ten celebrities. Did you know that he is already 84 years old? Does time really fly really fast? Do you also still say ‚Äúhandsome like Alain Delon‚Äù?
Handsome man in his prime
: // 73666 / When the world learned about Delon, his life changed dramatically. He turned into a serious and stately man who stopped doing stupid things. If you did not know, then in childhood and adolescence, Delon had many unpleasant situations, which he himself provoked. He wanted attention to himself, because he destroyed everything that he saw around. No one would have thought that from such a guy who does not sit still, there would be a wonderful actor.
In addition, Delon had to spend his entire childhood in boarding schools, and this greatly affected his psyche. Only acting helped him gain self-confidence. Since his first role, everything has changed. He felt his importance and masculine attraction.
: //1001.Thus, the image of a handsome man of all times and peoples was formed, on which the fans were ready to rush in droves. And it's hard to believe that he is already 84 years old. Is he as handsome?
Old age spares no one
Alain Delon has experienced many things in his entire life. He had an official wife with whom they had been married for 13 years. He cheated on her, found new hobbies. Women were too susceptible to his beauty. But this did not prevent Delon from maintaining friendly relations with Mireille.
//2017/-01. It is noteworthy that he stopped doing this when she found serious health problems. Then he returned to her and was engaged in treatment until 1982, until he finally solved the problem.
But nothing can fix such a person. If women themselves hung themselves on him, then he had nowhere to go from this. Since 1985, he has had many romances. It is even surprising that those who were much younger became his common-law wives. Delon has such a charm.
What does Delon look like at the moment?
// 155740/88 / 1557408883_0: 219: 2047: 1370_600_80_0_0_13 If some old people can be called cute, then this is not about Delon. Everyone is used to the fact that he is young and handsome, because many simply do not perceive him as old. He seems to everyone like an ordinary old man. But at the same time, Delon did not lose his emotional appeal. He has many young girls around him who are trying to please him in every way. His extreme wife turned out to be a model who married him at the age of 21 and even gave birth to two children.
Delon doesn't like that everyone associates him with the young guy he was many years ago. at the moment he is a successful person who has his own recording studio and many other projects. He provided not only for himself a comfortable old age, but also for his descendants. By the way, his son is also a real handsome man.
: // Delon is not upset. He likes the way he looks. But the main thing is to be a healthy person, as Alain himself claims. He has everything for a comfortable life. Only sometimes does he feel his true loneliness, which overwhelms the mood in moments. But he himself built such a model of behavior. He can buy whatever he wants, but real feelings cannot be bought with money. Do young girls pay attention to poor old people? Of course not.
/// 9/0 / But nature is so arranged that you can't argue against it. Delon is glad that at 84 he feels much younger. And therefore, you can still work in your favorite direction, and he will always have time to retire. How do you imagine old Alain Delon?
----------------------------------The oldest driver in Russia has been found. I tell him how old he is, where he lives and what he drives.

Greetings to you, readers and subscribers of the Autostars channel. In today's article, I want to tell you about a man who officially bears the title of the oldest driver in Russia.
The oldest driver in Russia is named Safarbi Tsaliev. He was born on March 23, 1923. He lives in the village of Dur-Dur in North Ossetia (about 60 km from Vladikavkaz). For the first time, Tsaliev sat behind the wheel of Safarbi in 1957 and has not parted with cars since then.
Safarbi Tsaliev. Illustration source - Yandex.Pictures
In 2019, at the age of 96, Safarbi Tsaliev was entered in the Russian Book of Records as the oldest driver of a vehicle in the "" category. At the moment, he is 97 years old and continues to drive his car.
It's funny that Safarbi Tsaliev drove almost all his life without a driver's license. In 1957, when he first sat behind the wheel, he did not even think that to drive a car you need to get a license. Then, of course, he found out about it, but he did not have free time to deal with this issue.
Safarbi Tsaliev. Illustration source - Yandex.Pictures
As a result, Safarbi Tsaliev received his first driver's license in his life only at the age of 95. He personally brought them home and handed them to the traffic police officer. True, before that, Safarbi Tsaliev still had to pass exams. But there were no problems with this.
Safarbi Tsaliev believes that he managed to drive without a license all his life and never got caught by traffic police due to his very careful driving. For 63 years, he never even got into a minor accident. Plus Safabri Tsaliev mostly traveled only to his native village, where everyone knows him.
Safarbi Tsaliev. Illustration source - Yandex.Pictures
In his entire life, Safarbi Tsaliev had only two personal cars. Most of the time he drove the collective farm GAZ-51 and GAZ-69. He bought his first car only in 1995, when he retired.
Safarbi Tsaliev did not have much money to buy a car, so he bought himself a new VAZ-1111. This car is popularly known under the name "Oka". The oldest driver in Russia has driven it for more than twenty years.
Safarbi Tsaliev. Illustration source - Yandex.Pictures
Three years ago Safarbi Tsaliev updated the car. Instead of the old "Oka", he bought a new Lada Kalina in the back of a hatchback. Safari Tsaliev is very pleased with his new cars.
The oldest driver in Russia calls his Lada Kalina a very reliable car. Safarbi Tsaliev confidently sits behind the wheel of his new car at any time of the year and in any weather.

Safarbi Tsaliev continues to drive Lada Kalina to this day. He plans to drive as long as his health allows.
Safarbi Tsaliev, despite his age, leads a fairly active lifestyle and is constantly on the move. Therefore, the car is his feet.

UFKActress and beauty. What does the illegitimate daughter of Alexander Mikhailov look like?



People's Artist of the RSFSR Alexander Mikhailov was married twice. The first wife, Vera Musatova, gave him a son, Konstantin, and in marriage with the second, Oksana Vasilyeva, a daughter, Miroslav, was born. But besides them, Alexander Yakovlevich also has an illegitimate daughter, Anastasia. How was her fate?
Like and subscribe to the channel "I love cinema" in Yandex Zen, so as not to miss our new publications.
Fruit of love
Alexander Mikhailov is known for his role as Vasya Kuzyakin in Vladimir Menshov's film Love and Doves. Just as the hero who glorified him allowed himself to have an affair on the side, Mikhailov himself in the late eighties became carried away by the actress Olga Kuznetsova, who on July 2, 1991 gave birth to his daughter Nastya. At that time, the actor's marriage was saved by his mother, who, despite her dislike for her daughter-in-law, forced Mikhailov to break up with Kuznetsova. Nevertheless, Alexander Yakovlevich recognized his illegitimate daughter and gave her his last name.
The famous actor took part in raising his daughter, but was categorically against her becoming an actress. Nevertheless, Anastasia decided to go against her father and enter VGIK, where he taught.
In 2008, Mikhailova first appeared on the screens in the film "Winner". The father often criticizes Anastasia's acting work, but the girl is not upset, but listens to his wisdom.
This publication has been produced in collaboration with
Wife and mother
Mikhailova actively starred in serials, but, unfortunately, mainly in episodic roles. The actress's father does not use his influence in the world of cinema to help her break through, and Anastasia herself says that she is waiting for a script that will help her open up. Despite the difference in age, Anastasia is friends with Miroslava, the daughter of Alexander Mikhailov from her second marriage.
In 2014, Anastasia married Evgeny Maiman.
- I found my bearded man in the world of cinema. But he's not an actor. I have never seen an actor as my life partner. I know firsthand how difficult it is when there are two artists in a family, ‚Äùshe told Express Gazeta about Eugene.
Mikhailova tries not to disclose the details of her personal life, but from her instagram we know that on December 8, 2018 she gave birth to her daughter Olivia. The last time the actress could be seen on the screens was in the TV series ‚ÄúGodunov. Continuation "in 2019.

Recently we have already told how we bought a village house in one of the villages of the Vologda region. The house is very old, built using the technologies of the century before last. Or rather, it can be said that it contains the wisdom of people who have lived in these places since ancient times, and have been improving their homes for hundreds of years so that they are as comfortable, warm and reliable as possible. And in this typical building for these places, their centuries-old experience was embodied.

But not only the house we liked here so much, we are completely delighted with the hedge. We used to live in the Leningrad Region, in a private house, in a summer cottage village. And it is clear what kind of fences there are - from a chain-link, from boards, metal, or other modern materials, you have all seen such a remake.
But this fence, like the house, was built according to old technologies. And so unusual for me. This is a real story, embodied in the fence, which is quite functional and, in my opinion, very beautiful. And the funny thing is that the fence is new. They put it just a few years ago. It was just that local people made it like their ancestors.

And I am especially surprised by how the gate is organized. It seems not to say that they are very comfortable, but how touching they are.
A wicket and next to the gate where the car enters
They consist of several long poles that are inserted into special grooves in the posts.

There are six poles in total. Yes, it's not that easy and quick - to put them all. These are not some modern sliding gates that open themselves, it is worth pressing a button from the remote control. But there is a soul in this hedge. This is a living history that is still preserved in some places.
The gate poles lie on the logs
I am very pleased that we have the same fence as in ancient black-and-white photographs of a century ago.
This photo was taken either in the Leningrad region or in Karelia, but the house is almost identical to ours. As well as the hedge.

And this, for comparison, hedges, which also used to stand in the Russian North. This type of fence is called a crane wing.


And here are a couple more options:



----------------------------------I saw that a neighbor was putting a reflective screen on the windshield: he told him why it was a mistake


Greetings, friends!
Hot summer days are not particularly pleasing for drivers, especially those who have to leave their car in open and well-lit parking lots. Sometimes the sun's rays warm up the interior so much that it is simply impossible to stay in it, and the car has to be thoroughly ventilated for a long time.
Many hope to solve this problem with a sunscreen - a thick reflective curtain fitted to the windshield. Recently I noticed that a neighbor in the parking lot at the house leaves just such a protective screen on his car. Of course, such a screen is inexpensive and very easy to use, and the intended effect should be quite tangible. But there are significant drawbacks to using it. Let's figure it out.
: // 288230376153108422 /
As you know, sunlight is largely composed of invisible infrared and ultraviolet radiation (especially in the middle of summer). The infrared part of the spectrum carries enormous amounts of heat. It is thanks to her that the interior warms up so much. And the ultraviolet component has a destructive effect on any objects. Because of it, paints fade, plastic dries up and cracks, all materials in the cabin are destroyed.
The sunscreen appears to solve these problems by blocking out the sun's rays. It is simply attached with suction cups, and if you choose the right size, it completely covers the windshield. At the same time, almost all commercially available screens are folded or folded, so they take up a minimum of space when not in use.
Cons of a sunscreen
Usually, if the parking space allows, the car is parked at such an angle that the protective screen completely covers the interior from the sun's rays. But the sun moves quickly, so after half an hour its rays begin to illuminate the interior through the side windows. However, this is not the main problem, since small reflective curtains are also sold for them.
The main problem is radiation to the windshield itself. Due to the reflection, it heats up a lot, and when the driver returns to the car and turns on the air conditioner, a sharp cooling occurs. This can lead to the formation of microcracks and the expansion of old defects. In rare cases, hot glass may crack completely immediately after turning on the air conditioner. They suffer from reflected ultraviolet radiation and wiper brushes, which quickly dry out under its influence.
How to replace the sunscreen?
It is much more effective to protect the car from solar radiation by using a regular cover. It is enough to throw it on the windshield and clamp it with the doors. This avoids the problems associated with sunscreens, while the vehicle's heat protection is much better because the cover is outside.

Gather your friends and family at one table and surprise with an original designed appetizer or salad. And ordinary bread will help you with this!


Well, let's get started?

For cooking we need:

Buckwheat bread - 4 pcs.
Your favorite salad

I draw your attention to the fact that bread should not be used dry and brittle, but those that can be cut and they will not break. I have the simplest and most inexpensive buckwheat bread. I bought them at the Magnit store.


I would be glad if you read the post to the end and want to visit my channel again!
Let's start cooking.

We take one loaf and, using a sharp knife, make neat rectangular cuts on it on both sides, trying to make them as similar as possible in shape and size.


We carry out this procedure with all the other loaves.


Then we collect such a "box" from them:


We transfer the finished "box" to a serving dish covered with lettuce leaves and fill it with your favorite salad. In this design, even the simplest salad will sparkle with bright colors and will certainly surprise your loved ones!

----------------------------------Alexander Petrov without photoshop: showing how he looks in real life



What does the star of the series "Policeman from Rublyovka" actually look like?
Find out in today's article!

Celebrities often appear before us in perfect guise: smooth, radiant skin, huge eyes, chic hair, a wonderful figure ...
All this is sometimes very misleading.
It is even more misleading to believe that only the beautiful half of humanity uses Photoshop.

What is the secret of Alexander Petrov?
It really surprises me.
Glory is on his heels.
Alexander Petrov, the most handsome man in Russia))
That's it.

He's definitely a nice guy, but give him the lead üôÜ
We are waiting for your comments.
Sasha Petrov is 31 years old, height 1.75 cm, was born in the city of Pereslavl-Zalessky.
Petrov has been in the cinema for ten years, he is incredibly popular, has many contracts, and so on.
I don't know, Alexander Petrov considers himself handsome, but in fairness, I will mention:
# no photoshop # stars without makeup # actors # fashion # men

In his instagram, Sasha posts a variety of photos, from "very photoshopped", but not very successful))
For example, you will not see this on Lazarev's Instagram account.
Everything is very staged there.
Alexander Petrov without photoshop.
What does it really look like?
Without photoshop, the actor is absolutely unremarkable.

Sasha has problems with his skin, huge bruises under his eyes and in general he looks very disheveled.
In my opinion.
But in the photos with Photoshop, a completely different person.
In films and TV shows, he is very well presented and do not forget that the actors are always in makeup.
By the way, we learned how the stars look without their makeup artists during the period of "house arrest".
In general, Alexander Petrov without Photoshop is not such a cutie at all.
As you can see, even the stars - men owe a lot to photoshop or even makeup.

Do you like Alexander Petrov?

----------------------------------The woman conducted an experiment and began to save on everything: in a year she managed to get rich and pay the mortgage


With the ability to manage your funds, you can eventually accumulate as much money as you need. At the same time, you can buy what seems incomprehensible. If you manage your income correctly, you can determine where to spend money, and what you can do without. This is a normal practice for people who value their time and effort.
They know what and how to do to feel free. At the same time, they ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù only those expenses that are secondary. What are your methods of saving money? Here is an Englishwoman who showed how a mortgage can be paid off in a year in a total economy. How did she do it? What amounts are we talking about?
"I see a purpose, but I do not see obstacles"
// 371/36/3 For a long time, journalist Michelle McGough lived for herself, for her own pleasure. she built her career in such a way that she had a more or less free schedule, which she herself planned. Once she asked herself the question: "For what and who am I living?" All because she lived in a rented apartment and spent money on vacation. She had already celebrated 38 years, and did not have her own home. She also did not have a husband, children, and even just a boyfriend.
She spent time outside of work with friends and went to visit relatives. They loved her, because she always wore gifts generously. This is normal, because Michelle did not particularly stress about finances anymore. She had a decent salary, she had authority in the circles of journalists. But everyone has a turning point. Michelle has it in terms of the meaning of life.
Then she took out a notebook and a pen. She wrote down how much money she usually gets. There were stable amounts that she received with a normal work schedule. She also wrote where and how much she usually spends. After that, she created a column where she wrote out the necessary and secondary expenses. It turned out that she spent almost all of her income on secondary expenses. For this reason, she did not have free money. But this is too frivolous for a woman of her age.
Change of world view
: //201701/647_011717014814 Michelle set herself a goal - to save up for a year for an apartment and write an interesting article about it that will be useful for readers. In addition, everything was based on real life events. She gave herself 365 days in which to achieve what she wanted. When the first day went, Michelle noticed that the first month was the most difficult. She had to give up going to cafes, meeting friends, guests with relatives.
Michelle also learned to do what she had not done before. She began to cook her own food on her own. If earlier it was more convenient for her to combine work and breakfast / lunch / dinner in a cafe, now she began to live differently. She found that buying groceries for a week was much cheaper than paying for food every time in a cafe.
: // As a result, Michelle restrained herself so as not to break. If she only acted for herself, she would give up immediately. But her readers held her back. She wanted to prove to everyone that what she had in mind was real.
She paid utility bills, rent an apartment, helped her parents pay basic expenses and bought groceries. At the same time, she did not update her wardrobe for a year and did not buy new shoes. She proved that it is quite possible to live in such a regime.
The result of the experiment
: // 2017/04/12/19/20170412190229044 / In 365 days, Michelle was able to accumulate 23 thousand dollars to pay off the mortgage on the apartment. Now she was the happiest person, which she shared with her readers with great pleasure.
Total economy brought her a result - an apartment. It was the greatest pleasure she had achieved on her own. The next question is family. Now she is open to communication with young people and does not mind starting a family. Everything has its time. Everyone himself understands when it is "time" for him. Do you agree with this?
----------------------------------10 facts about Italian films


Below you can only read the facts about the most famous Italian films.
***
The 1976 film "Disgusting, Dirty, Evil" was filmed almost entirely in the Roman quarter of Monti Chocchi, where the so-called Bindovili were located until the mid-70s. At first, the director wanted to make a documentary about the inhabitants of these places, but then changed his mind and shot a feature film with a plot.

In the film about Fantozzi, the creators thought for a long time how to make their daughter as "scary" as in the book. They eventually found actor Plinio Fernando, who was short, and gave him an enlarged nose.

The legendary film "Orchestra Rehearsal" was filmed in just 16 days. Then another six weeks were engaged in editing the voice acting.

The premiere of the film "Sunflowers", shot by Italians in the USSR, was to take place in Moscow. But the Soviet side demanded to make changes to the edited film, as there was a serious historical inaccuracy. The Italians refused to do so and held the premiere in Rome.


In the film "Waterloo" 15 thousand Soviet soldiers were employed in battle scenes (a film jointly produced by several countries).


In the film "Borsalino" the main roles were played by two stars of European cinema - Jean-Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon. Their prototypes were real gangsters Paul Carbon and Francois Spirito. The film "Borsalino" is a joint product of Italians and French.


Thanks to the film "La Dolce Vita", the word paparazzi came into use, which is derived from Paparazzo, the name of a friend of the photographer Marcello.


For the US release of Rocco and His Brothers, nearly 30 minutes of the film was cut out as it was deemed too violent for an American audience.


Alain Delon and Romy Schneider were in a relationship prior to filming the stars of the Italian-French co-op "Swimming Pool". But during filming, they were already apart.


In the movie "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow," Sophia Loren's heroine sits in a rare 1960 Ferrari. A total of 56 such machines were produced. One of them was sold at auction for $ 10 million.

----------------------------------Why it is impossible to show "The Bremen Town Musicians" to children


According to one of the editors of Kino In the opinion of one of the editors of KinoYa, even as a child, I did not like this Soviet musical cartoon. And having reviewed it now, I was completely disappointed in him.
Judge for yourself:
1. The princess begins to gnaw at some wandering artist, whom she sees for the first time in her life. What kind of man is he? Where from? What is good about him, besides cute looks? With the Troubadour, everything is clear. Any man would like to have a relationship with girls of royal blood.
In the cartoon, there is no period of acquaintance and agreement. Immediately into the arms. Decent girls don't do that.

2. The outrageous "troubadours" after being kicked out of the castle for misconduct, disguise themselves as robbers, kidnap (!) The king, tie him to a tree in the forest and leave him alone there. Already several serious criminal articles.
3. Then they themselves imitate a battle with robbers. The king is supposedly saved. The rogue troubadour, after such a fraud, is allowed to live in the palace, apparently with the princess.
And the princess is aware of the whole scheme. Lets do that to her father!
4. Next, the princess runs off into the night with this hippie-like rogue with a guitar, whom she sees for the first time. Escapes mainly because the animals were not allowed to live in the palace. In principle, the question can be solved - we would live nearby. But no, you have to cut from the shoulder.
But the father-king clearly does not like his daughter, he is raising her alone. For him, running away is a huge loss.
4. The inconsolable father hires an even more roguish detective.

5. Daughter is found, returned home with a fight. She chews on her father, not admitting her mistakes. The king is trying to lock up the inadequate fugitive at home. He's upset. And you, if your daughter behaved like that, wouldn't you be angry?
6. Musicians dress up as foreign singers and still steal their love. She happily escapes with them again into the unknown and poverty. An incorrigible hysteria. You could have solved the issue somehow differently.
Well, how can you show children such a piggy attitude towards their parents? How so lightly can you leave relatives, obligations, studies, title and throne, etc. etc.? A very bad example for the younger generation.

TalcIn what conditions does the 79-year-old actress live - Galina Stakhanova. A short tour of the actress's apartment.



Galina Stakhanova. Photo provided by Yandex Pictures service. Photo source // 24

Hello dear reader !!!
In today's article, we are going to visit the famous Soviet and Russian actress, Galina Stakhanova.
This year the actress turned 79 years old, but she is still full of strength and continues to delight us with albeit small, but still interesting, new roles.
But today our article is a bit different about who Galina Stakhanova is and what her merits in our cinema. Today you and I will take a short tour of the actress's apartment and see what conditions she lives in.

I think there is no particular need to delay, so let's start.

To be honest, first I wanted to show you how this apartment looked before the renovation, and thereby belittle our government a little, which admits that such honored people live in frankly sad conditions.
But then, after thinking a little, I decided not to show you the apartment until the renovation, because the actress herself is, of course, partly to blame for its deplorable state, so we will not discredit her.


Galina Stakhanova's apartment.

Pay attention - how the designers who designed this kitchen decided to equip a niche that many probably have.
In the corner, they installed a sink, and in the niche itself they placed part of the desktop, which in my opinion is very convenient and practical, although many, as I have seen, place a refrigerator in this place, which seems to me not a very good solution, because it is eaten quite a lot of free space.
Galina Stakhanova's apartment.
As you might have guessed, the main part of our little tour will take place in the kitchen, because it looks really amazing.

Kitchen.
Next to the large window, which is decorated with classic light beige tulle and light night curtains of contrasting burgundy color, there is a silver refrigerator.
On the floor with you we see linoleum which imitates light gray tiles. I know that many will surely say that linoleum has long gone out of fashion and is rarely used in repairs. But I disagree with you.
Sometimes linoleum looks much more interesting than laminate, and in terms of practicality, it is far ahead of the same, everyone's favorite laminate.
But most of all I liked this rather interesting dining table with a white, imitation marble top and classic light beige armchairs with high, straight backs.
The so-called -the dining area looks very elegant and stylish.
Galina Stakhanova's apartment.
A simple, but rather interesting and beautiful, classic chandelier is responsible for the lighting here.
Pay attention to the fact that the upper parts of the kitchen set are located under the very ceiling, which is certainly the right decision, because the kitchen is quite modest in size.
But most of all I liked not the very location of the kitchen set, but the color of the furniture fronts. The golden color with such a rather interesting element of aging and wear looks simply amazing.
Classic chandelier.
The lower parts of the kitchen set are also decorated with a golden facade and all with the same element of aging and wear.
But that's not all.
I don't know where the actress managed to find a gas stove of such an interesting color (bronze), but it just perfectly matches the color of the furniture facades.
In general, the color scheme of the kitchen set itself is simply amazing.
Bottom items of the kitchen set.
And of course, what kind of cuisine can do without a TV in our time?
Here we see that a small, plasma TV in a beige, decorative frame is located on the wall, next to the dining table, which may not be very convenient, but since it hangs here, then Galina likes it so much.
And most importantly, to please the hostess herself.

/Cossacks, village women with a yoke - how they looked in reality and how interesting they used the yoke


I remember that I really liked the description of the Cossack woman Aksinya in the novel "Quiet Don". So beautifully was shown her physical strength and female attractiveness in such a seemingly ordinary and difficult situation as dragging water with a yoke.
I'll even quote him:
"Aksinya scooped up another bucket; throwing a yoke over her shoulder, she went up the mountain with a slight sway. Grigory touched the horse after him. The wind ruffled the skirt on Aksinya, fingered small fluffy curls on his swarthy neck. in a skirt, without wrinkling, embracing a steep back and poured shoulders. Climbing up the hill, Aksinya leaned forward, clearly stretched under the shirt longitudinal groove on the back. Grigory saw brown circles fading from the armpits from the sweat of the shirt, followed his eyes with every movement. He wanted to talk to her".

What could those strong and beautiful women be like? I will show several photos taken at the beginning of the twentieth century by M.A. Krukovsky. True, in a completely different region of Russia. The main events of the novel take place in the Veshenskaya stanitsa in the north of the Rostov region. And these photos were taken in the southern Urals, in the Ufa and Orenburg provinces.
For example, just a Cossack woman with a yoke, photographed in 1908. For the photo, she was clearly dressed up here.

And now an unknown girl carries water from the river.

And these are peasant women with a yoke on Yuryuzan.
Russians. Chelyabinsk region (Ufa province.). 1908 g.
And here the girl, however, is not carrying water on the yoke, but linen, which she apparently washed in the river.

And here is the Simbirsk province, the end of the 19th century. Here I would like to pay attention not even to women, but to what various containers were used to carry water.
